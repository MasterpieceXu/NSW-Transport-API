    "# COMP9321 25T3 Assignment 2 v1.1 - (20 Marks)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will build a RESTful API using Flask-RESTX that allows three types of users - **Admin**, **Planner** and **Commuter** - to interact with Sydney’s bus network data. Planners can create and manage custom bus trips using real-world data from the Transport for NSW GTFS API. Commuters can browse and search for routes, stops, and trip schedules. There is a single Admin account which can only create/delete Planners and Commuters. Your API will store data in a local SQLite database and expose endpoints that are documented and testable via Swagger UI.\n",

    "## About the GTFS API\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transport for NSW GTFS Schedule API provides real-world public transport data in a standardised format. You will use this API to automatically download data at runtime for specific bus agencies (e.g., Busways, Transit Systems), which comes in `.zip` files containing CSV-like `.txt` files. Your API will parse this data and store it in a local SQLite database for further use.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing GTFS Data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) and paste the contents of `transport_api_swagger.json`.\n",
    "2. Identify the base URL and available endpoints (e.g., `GET /buses/GSBC001` for Busways R1).\n",
    "3. Store these endpoints as constants in your code.\n",
    "4. Review the API specification to understand how to pass your API key in the request headers.\n",
    "5. Each endpoint returns a `.zip` file containing multiple `.txt` files with GTFS data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the [TfNSW Technical Specification](https://developer.transport.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/2024-10/TfNSW_Realtime_Bus_Technical_Doc_v4.4.pdf) for more information about individual fields. See Page 22 for agency info.\n",

    "## Development Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "- Submit two Python files:\n",
    "  - `[your_zid]_api.py`: Your Flask-RESTX API implementation.\n",
    "  - `[your_zid]_tests.py`: Your automated test suite (REST client).\n",
    "- Use the provided `requirements.txt` to set up your virtual environment.\n",
    "- Use only libraries available in the environment (e.g., `pandas`, `matplotlib`).\n",
    "- Use **Python 3.13 only**.\n",
    "- Do **not** submit the `transport_api_key.env` file. Register at [Transport for NSW Open Data](https://opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au/) to obtain an API key. We will put our own key into this env file for marking.\n",
    "- Use only [SQLite](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) as your database. The database file should be created at runtime and not submitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirement Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Design one or more endpoints per requirement set based on the following functional requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Requirement Set 1: Admin - User Management (2 marks) \n",
    "- The API must be able to manage two types of users (**Planner** and **Commuter**). To achieve this, the API has only one dedicated user called 'Admin' which is able to access all endpoints, and also manage other users (add/remove).\n",
    "- The Planner and Commuter accounts must be able to be **activate/deactivate** by the Admin at any time.\n",
    "- The Admin can browse the list of users and all of their details.\n",
    "- Your code should create three users automatically in the first run with the following usernames and passwords:\n",
    "  | Username | Password | Role     |\n",
    "  |----------|----------|----------|\n",
    "  | admin    | admin    | Admin    |\n",
    "  | commuter | commuter | Commuter |\n",
    "  | planner  | planner  | Planner  |\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Admin can perform any action using the API.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Planners can perform any action except User Management.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Commuters can perform any action except User Management and Importing GTFS Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirement Set 2: Importing Bus Agency's Data from the GTFS API (2 marks)\n",
    "- Planners and the Admin can import bus agency data using their ID (e.g., `SBSC006`).\n",
    "- Only agencies prefixed with `GSBC` or `SBSC` (in the Sydney Metro area) are valid.\n",
    "- Store all GTFS data recieved for the agency from the GTFS API in `[your_zid].sqlite`. In the following requirement sets, you will be fetching/storing the data from/in your local database (e.g, if any user tries to access data which has not been already imported the API should return Not Found Error).  \n",
    "- Planners/Admin may decide to re-import another agency's data at any time. This will replace the existing data for an already imported agency. You can assume resource IDs (e.g., trip id) will not change after re-import. \n",
    " \n",
    "### Requirement Set 3: Data Access (2 marks)\n",
    "- All users can retrieve information about a specific route, trip, or stop by its id.\n",
    "- All users can retrieve information about all of the routes for an agency by its id.\n",
    "- All users can retrieve information about all of the trips for a specific route by its id.\n",
    "- All users can retrieve information about all of the stops for a specific trip by its id.\n",
    "- There might be a very large number of items for a single query, and browsing must be efficiently managed as per RESTful API design practices.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirement Set 4: Exploring Stops (2 marks)\n",
    "- All users can search stops by name (e.g., `Circular Quay`) to get any routes and trips associated with the stop.\n",
    "- The search handles base text matching including: ignoring case (`circular quay`), and accepting partial matches (e.g., `Quay`, `circula`). Use the RapidFuzz library.\n",
    "- The results may return zero or more stops matching the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirement Set 5: Favourite Routes (2 marks)\n",
    "- All users can manage (add, delete, update) their own favourite list of routes.\n",
    "- All users can have no more than two favourite routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirement Set 6: Visualisation and Data Export (3 marks)\n",
    "- All users can generate a map showing the shape of their favourite routes. Your API should return the image as a byte stream that can be rendered directly in the browser, rather than as a file for download.\n",
    "- It should also include the route information for the trip.\n",
    "- The user may also export the data as a csv file instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Global Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The following requirement sets are non-functional requirements and they apply to all endpoints you design in your API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirement Set 7: API Design & Documentation (5 marks)\n",
    "Your API must follow the best practices in designing RESTful APIs: \n",
    "- Designing and grouping endpoints.\n",
    "- Using appropriate HTTP methods.\n",
    "- Avoiding excessive or redundant endpoints.\n",
    "- Using appropriate parameter types (e.g., Query Parameters, Header Fields, Path Parameters, Payload).\n",
    "- Handling user inputs and errors.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Generate a fully documented Swagger UI using Flask-RESTX.\n",
    "- Each endpoint must include:\n",
    "  - Summary and description\n",
    "  - Request and response models\n",
    "  - Status codes and error messages\n",
    "  - Role-based access notes\n",
    "- Swagger UI must be:\n",
    "  - Reachable and testable via browser\n",
    "  - Fully interactable\n",
    "  - Self-explanatory\n",
    "  - Synchronised with your implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "> Failure to implement a working Swagger UI will result in losing marks for all other sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirement Set 8: Testing (2 marks)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Submit `z[your_zid]_tests.py` with automated tests for requirement sets 1–6.\n",
    "- Each test must include:\n",
    "  - Main functionality tests\n",
    "  - Edge case tests\n",
    "  - Clear comments/docstrings stating:\n",
    "    - Requirement number\n",
    "    - Purpose of the test\n",
    "- Include assertions for:\n",
    "  - HTTP status codes\n",
    "  - JSON response structure and data\n",
    "  - Error messages for invalid cases"
